## Objective:
 The objective of my Excel project was to improve my proficiency in using 
spreadsheets and Excel's features for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Through 
this project, I aimed to enhance my ability to organize and manipulate data, perform 
calculations and analysis, and create visual representations of data using charts and 
graphs.

## Data gathering & cleaning:
 - For my Excel project, I started by gathering a dataset related to bike sales from 
GitHub. I downloaded the dataset in its raw format, which was provided in a CSV file.
-  To begin the data cleaning process, I imported the CSV file into Excel and created a 
working sheet to work with a copy of the raw data.
 - I focused on cleaning the data by identifying and removing any duplicate entries. By 
removing duplicates, I ensured that each bike sale record was unique and accurate.
 - Additionally, I noticed that certain columns in the dataset contained abbreviations for 
variables such as marital status and gender. To make the data more understandable and 
consistent, I replaced these abbreviations with their corresponding full forms.
 - Furthermore, I organized the age data into meaningful groups to facilitate 
visualization. I created a new column using Excel's IF function to categorize individuals 
into age groups such as "Adolescent," "Middle Age," and "Old" based on their age 
values.
 - Throughout the data cleaning process, my focus was on ensuring data accuracy, 
consistency, and usability for further analysis and visualization tasks.
 
 ## Data Processing:
 - Once the data gathering and cleaning phase was completed, I proceeded with data 
processing in Excel for my project.
 - To begin, I created a separate worksheet dedicated to the analysis and visualization 
of the bike sales data. This worksheet served as the foundation for data processing 
tasks.
 - One of the key data processing steps I took was the creation of a pivot table. By 
utilizing Excel's pivot table feature, I was able to summarize and aggregate the bike 
sales data based on different variables such as sales data, customer demographics, and 
product details. This allowed for easier analysis and visualization of the data.
 - Additionally, I leveraged Excel's charting capabilities to create visual representations 
of the bike sales data. By selecting the appropriate chart types and configuring the data 
series, I was able to present the insights and trends in a visually appealing manner.
 - Throughout the data processing phase, I focused on generating meaningful insights 
and presenting them in a clear and understandable manner. Excel's functions, formulas, 
and features were utilized to manipulate and analyze the data effectively, enabling me 
to gain valuable insights from the bike sales dataset.


## Conclusion:
 - The Excel project focused on analyzing bike sales data and presenting key insights 
using formulas, functions, pivot tables, and charts. The project demonstrated the 
importance of data cleaning, organization, and visualization in facilitating data analysis 
and decision-making.
 - Through data cleaning, duplicate entries were removed, ensuring the accuracy and 
integrity of the dataset. The organization of data, such as categorizing age groups and 
converting abbreviations into full forms, improved data readability and comprehension.
 - The use of pivot tables and charts allowed for a comprehensive visual representation 
of the data, enabling stakeholders to easily understand sales trends, product
performance, and customer satisfaction ratings. The sales dashboard provided a 
centralized view of the data, aiding in quick analysis and identification of important 
patterns.
-  Key insights gained from the project include the popularity of mountain bikes among 
customers, variations in average sales prices across bike categories, seasonal sales 
trends, regional sales performance, and positive customer satisfaction ratings.
 - Overall, the Excel project enhanced my understanding of spreadsheet functionalities, 
data cleaning techniques, and data visualization capabilities. It emphasized the 
significance of accurate and well-organized data in driving effective business decisions.
